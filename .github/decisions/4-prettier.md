## Context

There are often debates about code style that can easily be avoided so we can focus on impact to the business. We also want to increase readability via consistent code style. An opinionated code formatter can help with this.

## Decision

Use Prettier to enforce code style.

## Consequences

- Developers will need to run `npm run format` to format code.
